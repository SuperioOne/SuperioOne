 ## **About Me**

</div>


A computer engineer who loves tinkering with multiple software disciplines occasionally creates 3D models, enjoys self-hosting services. 
Professionally, I mostly work on .NET backends and occasionally work on React frontends. However, in my personal projects, I prefer working with Rust, C/C++, Htmx, and Svelte.
